# Google-Advanced-Data-analytics-Capstone-Project
**Project Overview:**

This capstone project is centered around using data analysis and predictive modeling to assist the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm. The goal is to develop insights that can help the company manage its workforce more effectively, particularly in predicting employee turnover.

**Key Objectives:**

Data Analysis: The project begins with a comprehensive analysis of the provided dataset, focusing on identifying key factors that contribute to employee retention and turnover. The analysis involves cleaning the data, exploring the features, and visualizing the relationships between variables.

**Predictive Modeling:**
The core of the project is building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of an employee leaving the company. 

**There are two primary approaches to achieve this:**

**Regression Model:** A traditional statistical method where the target variable (employee turnover) is modeled as a function of various predictors (e.g., age, job satisfaction, salary).

**Machine Learning Model:** A more complex approach involving algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines to predict employee turnover based on patterns in the data.

**Model Evaluation and Interpretation:** Once the model is built, it is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve. The results are interpreted to understand the key drivers of employee turnover, providing actionable insights to the HR department.

**Data Visualization:** Throughout the project, data visualization plays a crucial role in both the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase and in presenting the results of the predictive models. Visuals like bar charts, heatmaps, and ROC curves are used to communicate findings effectively.

**Practical Applications:**

**Employee Retention Strategies:** The insights generated from this project can help the HR department develop targeted retention strategies, such as identifying at-risk employees and addressing their concerns proactively.

**Data-Driven Decision Making:** The use of predictive models allows the company to move from intuition-based decision-making to evidence-based approaches, improving overall HR effectiveness.
